# Data Science Portfolio

Hey, thanks for coming! Below you will be albe to take a look at the different projects that I have been working on during the last time. There is a mix of Machine Learning and visualization projects, using R and Python. Enjoy! 

## [Argentina COVID-19 Analysis](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Covid-19-LogisticRegression-RProgramming)

### R Programming

Here you will find some interesting vizualizations about the COVID-19 situation in Argentina. I have used information from February 2020 to September 2020 and analyzed different paramenters providede the the Ministry of Heath. Also, I have a applied a logarithmic regression model to predict if people will recover from COVID or not. (In progress)

## [Titanic Visualization - Final Pandas Project](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Data-Science.Projects/blob/main/zerotopandas_course_project.ipynb)

### Python

In this code, you will see some curious concepts about the famous Titanic Dataset. There are different bar charts and histograms that help us to understand the situation that this dataset represents.

## [Automation GUI](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Data-Science.Projects/blob/main/Import - Analysis - Export.R)

### R Programming

This is a GUI application, that I have combined with the KeyboardSimulator library, that allowed me to automate one of my daily processes. Basically it consist of a loop, that works with a user-friendly grapghical user interface.

## [Merval Anlysis Tool](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Merval_Analysis_Tool)

This is a web app that allows us to analyze different aspects of the Merval Stock Market.

You can select a specific sector and take look at all the companies that are included in that group. And also, you can select a specific Stock to look at its information.

You can try the webapp in the following [LINK](https://share.streamlit.io/chaspeer/merval_analysis_tool/main/merval.py)

# Data Science Portfolio

Hey, thanks for coming! Below you will be albe to take a look at the different projects that I have been working on during the last time. There is a mix of Machine Learning and visualization projects, using R and Python. Enjoy! 

## [Argentina COVID-19 Analysis](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Covid-19-LogisticRegression-RProgramming)

### R Programming

Here you will find some interesting vizualizations about the COVID-19 situation in Argentina. I have used information from February 2020 to September 2020 and analyzed different parameters provided by the Ministry of Heath. Also, I have a applied a logarithmic regression model to predict people Covid-19 recovery.

## [Titanic Visualization - Final Pandas Project](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Data-Science.Projects/blob/main/zerotopandas_course_project.ipynb)

### Python

In this code, you will see some curious concepts about the famous Titanic Dataset. There are different bar charts and histograms that help us to understand the situation that this dataset represents.

## [Automation GUI](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Data-Science.Projects/blob/main/GUI + KeySimulator.R)

### R Programming

This is a GUI application, that I have combined with the KeyboardSimulator library, that allowed me to automate one of my daily processes. Basically it consist of a loop, that works with a user-friendly grapghical user interface.

## [Pivot in R](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Data-Science.Projects/blob/main/Analysis + Pivot.R)

### R Programming

In this script, you will find some analysis performed into a dataset, including importing the data, deleting and formatting variables, appending tables, and grouping and generating new variables. After that, I have generated a pivot table for reporting purposes.

## [Data Preparation & Analysis](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Data-Science.Projects/blob/main/Import - Analysis - Export.R)

### R Programming

The challenge for this job was that I had to prepare different Excel files, from a source data that had more rows than the max limit of Excel. Because of that, I generated a script that allowed me to import the data, format it as expected and export it with an Excel format.

## [Merval Anlysis Tool - Out of service](https://github.com/Chaspeer/Merval_Analysis_Tool)

### Python

This is a web app that allows us to analyze different aspects of the Merval Stock Market.

You can select a specific sector and take look at all the companies that are included in that group. And also, you can select a specific Stock to look at its information.

You can try the webapp in the following [LINK](https://share.streamlit.io/chaspeer/merval_analysis_tool/main/merval.py)
